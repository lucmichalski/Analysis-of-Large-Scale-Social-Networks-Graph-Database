>Dear fellow AFOL,

>We apologize for the radio-silence of the last couple of weeks. We have been dealing with the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic on both personal and professional levels. Some of you have contacted us and we still need to answer those emails. We’re sorry about that, we’re going to try to get back to you as soon as possible.

>It has been a period to reflect on the future. We started 4DBrix because we had several ideas to increase the playability of LEGO® creations by combining 3D printing, electronics and programming. We are proud of what we achieved and we’re grateful for all the support and wonderful feedback we got from many of you. Unfortunately not everything is awesome in our AFOL community...

>One of the first things we did was launching a kickstarter campaign to introduce our modular switches. The campaign was successful... too successful actually. Before we had shipped out the tracks to all our backers there were already copies of our modular system being sold. It didn’t stop there, in the following years that same company started systematically copying our train products. It has become clear that copying our ideas is their core business strategy. To our surprise this is not only condoned by a part of our community, some prominent members of the AFOL community are actively supporting this. In the long run, this is not a sustainable situation.

>We’ve always focused on what’s in the best interest of our community, e.g. our nControl software has always been available to everybody for free, and want to continue to do so. One of the main concerns we found in your feedback was the cost of our products. We’re located in the US so our production costs are high, there’s not much we can do about that. That’s why we decided to transform 4DBrix into a Do-It-Yourself platform.

>We will release our 3D print models so you can print the parts yourself. We’ll also release building instructions for the automation components so you can build your own automation system from readily available off-the-shell components. We understand that some of you don’t have a 3D printer and/or don’t have the skills or interest in assembling electronics. That’s why we’re looking for 3D print and electronics enthusiasts who want to set up a micro-business and start producing for their local AFOL community. Like that we can also get rid of long distance shipping. If you’re interested in this, please let us know.

>It’s a radical change and we believe it’s the best way to move forward. We’ll start by updating our website site: adding download links to the models, assembly instruction and all the other information you need to build your dream layout, so stay in touch!

Documents relating to this post:

[A public announcement from the CEO of Lowes  posted April 2nd.](https://newsroom.lowes.com/inside-lowes/lowes-responding-covid-19-essential-retailer/)

[Oregon Executive Order 20-12](https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-12.pdf)

[The Letter of Resignation that was presented to me and I’d begun to fill out.](https://i.imgur.com/4Lehtc2.jpg)

I have been an employee at the 11th Avenue Lowes in Eugene, Oregon for about two months, beginning my employment there as an outside garden loader a short time before this crisis really began to unfold. Over the course of the past week I have witnessed regular, habitual disregard towards proper sanitation and social distance practices. These include instances which I believed violated the spirit of executive order 20-12 but also ones which simply contradicted public statements of Lowes efforts to protect its customers and associates made by CEO Marvin Ellison. In noticing these things I made my best efforts to document them, explain my concerns, print the relevant internal documentation and highlight parts of e.o 20-12 and our CEO’s statements in order to show where we could make efforts to better meet their expectations both to the letter of the word and in good faith common sense efforts.


At approximately 2:00 PM yesterday I was brought into the training room with the store manager, one assistant manager, and a department manager and offered a letter of resignation.  I was told by the GM that it was apparent that I had “absolutely no faith in our efforts here” and that their offer was I could sign the letter of resignation and willfully terminate my employment, and then I could draw unemployment. The GM then continued to state that the alternative was I would be placed on a zero-hour leave, punctuating that point by stating that it would mean I would have no source of income. While I have had no further contact with the store, it seems this means I am currently still employed and appointed to zero-hours.

At no point before this have I received any warning against my conduct nor have I ever faced any disciplinary action. In fact, I have believed that my conversations with the GM, my direct manager, and another department manager of the store had resulted in them understanding at least some of my concerns and that they would be addressed. When each day that I came in for my shifts and I witnessed the same problems, I simply continued to document them and explain why I felt they were in violation of the letter and spirit of these public and internal ordinances and bring that information again to these managers. When in instances these were things that I perceived to be immediately dangerous I did take the initiative to inform other associates, such as how non-alcoholic benzalkodium chloride hand sanitizer are not effective against Covid-19.

Here is a summary of my concerns, and what I asked them to do to assuage them:

1. Social Distancing Guidelines at both a locally legislated level and the actions being touted by our CEO are not being enforced. While six foot distance markers have been placed at registers, egress into the store is not managed in any meaningful ways. Customers are congregating to socialize at our entrances. They are also making use of our display patio furniture at such a high volume that it is essentially a public sitting area which we have made no attempts to sanitize or limit access to. It should be noted however that instructions to block off the display furniture had came down the internal pipelines yesterday, so maybe they’ll finally do it. (While writing this a co-worker informed me they have now been sectioned off. Yay!)

2. We have inadequate sanitation practices. 
As of over a week ago we have entirely ran out of alcohol based cleaning solutions. Bottles of non-alcoholic sanitizers with the sole active ingredient of Benzalkonium Chloride have been provided to associates for personal use and been left at work terminals and these have been touted as effective against the Covid-19 virus despite that being easily shown to be false. After I had shown several members of management this information they began to state that the bottles also contained a percentage of alcohol, one manager quoting an 80% content and one who helped escort me from the store quoting 40%. When I asked if he could in any way verify that claim, he told me to stop playing games and just to leave. -------- We have Hepestat 256 but we are not able to follow its instructions by allowing it to sit for a meaningful length of time. At each register you will find a purple spray bottle and one or two microfiber cloths. The first days we had directly sprayed the card terminals and registers but since some electronic failures we have switched to wiping with the microfiber cloths. These clothes are not being managed to maintain their sanitation except to be periodically gathered up and replaced. They are used indiscriminately between wiping carts, registers, and other various surfaces and then haphazardly draped over the bottle or tossed under registers until their next use. Many have survived over multiple days.


3. As per CEO Marvin Ellisons statement on April 2nd Lowes has publicly announced that our stores will have all appointed Social Distance Ambassadors to control customer egress and flow through the store. We also have received a new application on our handheld devices which would allow us to count access to the store. After asking about our store’s efforts to adhere to this I was informed that it was decided our stores capacity would be 500 people, and that since we had not approached those numbers even before the crisis, we would not need to follow these guidelines. ----- When I asked how that number (500) was determined I was given conflicting answers by the GM - that it was generated based on our square footage, then that it was determined from above his head, then that the application was broken and unusable. I was able to access the application on a phone and could see it functioned just fine, with it being a simple shared counter that allowed an administrator to set a maximum number and tally incoming and outgoing customers until it reached it. The application has since been disabled from being accessed by non-management, and when it’s attempted to be used, states that access is unauthorized. ----- On April 5th we continued with our “Spring Black Friday” sale. I witnessed an older customer, well into his eighties, bring the advertisement behind the plexiglass barrier to show the cashier. He leaned into the cashier, bringing their faces together, and only reluctantly stepped back when I requested he do so. The next day, that employee went home sick one hour into his shift. Only minutes later, I witnessed a loader placing bags of mulch into the back of a customer’s vehicle while working shoulder-to-shoulder with that customer. When I explained to them both that we still had to maintain the six-foot rule while loading, and that either one of us loaders could finish (with me offering to), or the customer could complete the load. The customer aggressively asked if I had been tested for the virus, and when I said I hadn’t he claimed that he had been and the test had came up negative. They finished loading side-by-side, the customer muttering angrily about me the entire time. Management at every level of the store is aware that interactions like this are occurring by the minute within our store, and don’t feel any obligation to prevent them.

4. Our communication is poor. Associates come into the store for their shifts and are immediately sent to their posts. Any information they receive about local or internal expectations and efforts regarding Covid-19 responses are received by casual, hearsay word-of-mouth. It was two days after the April 2nd announcement before it seemed everyone knew they were going to earn $2 an hour more, but a week later and no one seemed to be aware of other aspects of that same public announcement such as the promise of appointing social distancing ambassadors and setting a customer limit. On Saturday April 4th when I started my shift I was prevented by the GM of the store from accessing the training computers and instructed to go directly to my post. Employees should be educated and kept up to date with these measures, and impressed upon that many of them are expected.

Since I am meandering a bit I would like to complete this post with a quick overview of the sort of actions I had been proposing to management, which I had impressed upon them I would like to be seen done sooner than later. Some are common sense, easily dealt with issues and others are a little tougher but still both reasonable and the right thing to do. Others I still believe they have no intention to address, or will continue to avoid until the absolutely last moment. This list is in essence what I most often presented to the management.


1. Set a customer limit to the store based on CDC guidelines, local legislation, or preferably determined by appraising the actions of similar stores located in states which are currently being more harshly affected by the virus. As part of this and further complying with our public statements, I would like the appointing of social distance ambassadors who can ensure adherence to social distancing guidelines and protect cashiers against non-compliant customers. Our internal memos also mention appointing an ambassador in outside lawn and garden to monitor customer flow there.


2. Since we do not have access to Covid-19 appropriate personal sanitizers, particularly at Lumber and Outside Lawn and Garden, the establishment of hand washing stations at these entrances. Better yet, appointing these areas as outgoing traffic only and managing egress through the front entrance.

3. More conscientious cart management. Reduce the number of circulating carts to a reasonable level based on our calculating customer limit and establish a two-stage sanitation routine. Since we’re using Hepestat 256 carts should be sprayed and quarantined for 10 minutes before being brought forward for customer use. Novelty carts such as the large blue racecars that can seat two children should be pulled from circulation.

4. Regular safety meetings regarding our companies evolving policies, reassuring cashiers of their rights and responsibilities to maintain 6ft distance, education on how they can use the sick days provided by the company when they feel like they’re starting to feel sick so that they are not so stressed about requesting to leave. Currently meetings are only held at 8:00 A.M. and for any who came in afterwards they go straight to their register or department. I was in fact discouraged from taking time to access weekly playbook documents because we were so busy from our Spring Black Friday Sale. When I expressed my concerns that I’d like to know our new policies, I was told by the GM that it was more important that I be outside. When he came out a half hour later, it turns out we had had new policies enacted, and I had been violating them.

5. Establish a limit of two customers per party. We have had far too many large groups and families which require customers to violate the six foot rule simply to move past. When these groups congregate in between paint and customer’s service, they often do so without regard for the six foot rule. Furthermore, casual non-essential shopping should be discouraged by asking that customers come to the store with a shopping list. Shoppers who are casually browsing should be asked to leave and return after they’ve determined what they wish to purchase. I have been told repeatedly by customers they are simply there to kill time. The GM of the store has also stated to me that he believes this is a part of our essential service to the community, to preserve a feeling of “normalcy” in his words. I would like for this perspective of the situation to be discouraged entirely. To be clear, it is the GM's opinion that because we are being allowed to stay open as an essential business that every aspect of our business is essential. Furthering that logic, since it is his belief that part of our business services is providing members of our community, particularly older members of the community, with a place to congregate and feel at ease that this is in fact a continued part of the essential services we provide. How obviously this contradicts the intent of being designated as essential shouldn't need much explanation.

So why am I making this post? I have just one request from everyone. If you shop at the 11th Ave. Lowes look to see if you believe they are holding themselves to the standards expected of them outlined in both e.o. 20-12 and from Lowes own publicly announced intentions. If you believe they are making a good faith, reasonable effort to uphold their responsibilities in curbing the spread of this disease please treat them kindly, keep your distance, be incredibly patient and mention your cashier by name on your receipt survey. I ask you to please stop coming in without being confident about what you're shopping for and particularly stop coming in day after day just to buy a couple things at a time for an evolving project. Take some time to really determine what you'll need.

Finally if you go there and it seems their efforts are continuing to be lackluster - if you see something, say something. It may be that my intentions and interpretations of the situation have been misguided, but I sincerely don't believe so.

"{created_utc_str:2020-04-06 00:13:53,score:1,stickied:false,downs:0,edited:false,ups:1,id:fmjkb2s,body:Benjamin Ricker

Benjamin Ricker is not in it to win it — he says his intention in running for mayor is to assure the right issues are being talked about.

""Give some serious thought to what you see happening in Eugene with homelessness and poverty,"" Ricker said.

Ricker doesn't believe he can raise the money to compete in the citywide race, and he isn't presenting detailed plans to solve housing issues in Eugene. Ricker believes the mayoral race requires someone to pull conversations toward the area's most vulnerable people.

Homelessness and poverty, Ricker said, are important pieces of the city's larger concerns. Those are his core issues.

""I see those issues connected to a lot of other issues,"" Ricker said.

Ricker is an artist and a stay-at-home father. He said attendance, in person or virtually, at city council meetings over the last year demonstrated to him the city requires new leadership. He doesn't believe the mayor and city council members are ""walking the walk.""

Ricker said he supports the Housing First model but did not offer a plan to make permanent homes readily available for the unhoused. He opposes city rules that ""criminalize the homeless,"" such as last year's decision that made being on planting strips a form of trespassing.

But he believes the pandemic and the need for social distancing will deflate the campaign season.

""The pandemic zapped a lot of the opportunity we had to debate this,"" he said. ""But these are the new rules. It's important to stay home.""

Lucy Vinis

Lucy Vinis believes responding to the human and economic tolls of the pandemic would define her second term as mayor.

""Everything will have to be recalibrated,"" Vinis said.

During her tenure, Vinis said the city worked toward solutions for the housing crunch, providing for the unhoused and climate change. She pointed to the passage last year of a construction excise tax meant to support the building of affordable housing in Eugene.

The council soon will discuss how to spend the first year's collection of that tax. It's one of the things Vinis said she wants to see through.

""I'm eager to serve a second term because I want to see those changes on the ground,"" Vinis said. ""There's a value to consistency and a steady hand on those particular issues.""

Vinis said Eugene's affordable housing situation has continued to worsen in recent years. She said the pandemic is going to make it worse and the problem more necessary to solve than ever. Vinis said she's committed to funding a permanent shelter based on the 2018 Technical Assistance Collaborative (TAC) report to address homelessness, an issue she called ""the most pressing in the public mind.""

The mayor is concerned the pandemic – in overturning the local economy, sickening its people and disrupting social patterns – could hamper efforts to implement the TAC report or fund the city's Climate Action Plan. But in the crisis, Vinis said she also sees opportunity.

""Lessons learned in the Stay Home, Stay Alive policy could inform this response – at the very least, more of us could telecommute more frequently to reduce our use of fossil fuels,"" Vinis said in answers to a Register-Guard questionnaire.

Vinis said her first term has taught her the functions of local government. She believes she'll be more effective as a second-term mayor.

""I enjoy being mayor, and I am committed to this community,"" Vinis said.

Matthew Yook

Matthew Yook is running for mayor on a platform of transparency.

The freelance data analyst decided to join the race in February and believes more of the city's government meetings need to be broadcast online or otherwise made accessible for locals. Yook believes the local distrust of government he's encountered can be reduced by making it more accessible.

""I want to try to deconstruct as much animosity in Eugene as possible,"" Yook said.

Yook supports making green energy a more important part of the local economy, suggesting Eugene can work with local companies like electric vehicle manufacturer Arcimoto to reduce fossil fuel consumption by the city's fleet.

Yook said he also would prioritize finding a way to expand Eugene's fiber optic internet network beyond the borders of downtown. He said local businesses are struggling to compete with corporate giants, but with access to better internet Yook sees a chance for growth.

Watching how the pandemic has unfolded in Eugene, Yook said local government should do more to inform residents about upcoming aid and relief packages from the federal government. He said he'll likely have to send his message to potential voters through digital means.

""I've never seen anything like this before. We need to open as many channels as possible,"" Yook said.

Zondie Zinke

Zondie Zinke said she hadn't decided to run for mayor until she watched Vinis give the most recent State of the City address.

She said she didn't buy what the mayor was selling –accusing Vinis of failing to speak the truth about the city's climate change goals.

""We have got to think outside the status quo parameters,"" Zinke said. ""The first step is acknowledging the truth of that.""

Zinke believes Eugene must pilot aggressive changes to meet the needs of a deteriorating global climate. She said she supports the principles of the Green New Deal and argued that if voluntary climate change programs prove insufficient, they should be mandatory.

When it comes to housing, Zinke said in an answer to a Register-Guard questionnaire that she would direct city staff to identify progressive funding mechanisms that would allow the city to buy ""a significant level"" of affordable and mixed-income social housing.

Zinke said it's important to remember the role of mayor in Eugene is to be a prominent voice on major issues and to set the agenda.

But she's not convinced anyone in the race will be able to muster the kind of campaign necessary to unseat an incumbent.

A mother and a social worker for Looking Glass Community Service, Zinke said running gave her pause but in the end she decided more voices were needed to assure the mayoral race went beyond the May 19 primary.

""There is no risk in voting for someone other than Mayor Vinis,"" Zinke said. ""And then you get a chance to decide who you really like."",created_utc:1586132033}","{created_utc_str:2020-04-05 20:16:09,created_utc:1586117769}","{created_utc_str:2020-04-06 00:13:53,created_utc:1586132033}","{created_utc_str:2020-04-06 00:13:53,created_utc:1586132033}","{created_utc_str:2020-04-05 20:16:09,score:9,upvote_ratio:0.84,selftext:The Register-Guard: Candidates for Eugene mayor.

The candidates for mayor in Eugene are: Thomas Hiura, Robert Patterson, Benjamin Ricker, Lucy Vinis, Stacey Westover, Matthew Yook and Zondie Zinke. A candidate who gets more than 50% of the vote on May 19 wins. If no one does, the top two are on the November ballot.

In addition to phone interviews, each candidate completed a questionnaire.

Thomas Hiura

At the top of Thomas Hiura’s agenda are completion of the Beltline and Delta Highway interchange project and ending street harassment in Eugene.

Though the interchange project is funded and controlled by the state highway department, Hiura said he would leverage local influence to expedite the $20 million construction plan meant to relieve traffic in a regularly crowded area.

Hiura believes homeless in Eugene have been dispersed from downtown for the sake of commerce and curb appeal and other neighborhoods, such as areas on Highway 99 and River Road, are asked to carry an unfair burden.

Hiura returned to Eugene last year from teaching in the New York City public school system. He most recently was a bellhop and a shuttle driver at the Graduate until the pandemic forced staff layoffs. Soon, Hiura expects to start work with the U.S. Census Bureau.

""While homelessness and youth mental health are key issues in my campaign, these issues would have already been solved along with climate change if our hyper-partisan democracy was not broken. This is embodied by Eugene’s local establishment, which overlaps significantly with a center-right party called the Democrats,"" Hiura said in a Register-Guard questionnaire.

Hiura said another of his top priorities as mayor would be ending street harassment such as catcalling or verbal attacks on unhoused residents. He posed that position as more tangible than the ""Choose Kindness"" campaign Vinis supported, something he said ""accomplishes virtually nothing.""

Hiura said he supports allowing taller buildings in Eugene and making it easier for locals to build accessory dwelling units on their properties, efforts he believes will increase the city's housing stock.

Hiura called himself an ""ardent environmentalist"" and said as mayor he would push for public and private electric vehicle infrastructure.

""I am a rare candidate who plans to live here in the 2070s, and we need to be full generations beyond fossil fuels,"" Hiura said.

Robert Patterson

Robert Patterson says his mission as mayor would be to look at every aspect of city operations from the standpoint of people in poverty.

""I get the sense Eugene is at a crossroads,"" Patterson said.

Creating more living space in Eugene, especially for the unhoused and those who can't afford market rate rent, is at the top of his agenda.

Patterson said he would apply the ""Housing First"" model, which foregoes moving people experiencing homelessness through different levels of housing such as transitional programs and instead offers them permanent accommodations as the first step of the process.

Patterson, who is homeless, acknowledged that approach is expensive and proposed a substantial bond measure to pay for housing.

""It would not be an easy thing to pass, but fundamentally the people of Eugene are compassionate,"" Patterson said. ""It is in keeping with the sacred traditions of Oregon to expand opportunities to these people.""

Patterson does not have previous government experience. He is a Virginia native who came to Eugene in 2008 before moving to Portland, where he said he first became homeless. Patterson moved back to Eugene last summer and spent time with Eric Jackson, who has led protest camps, which showed Patterson some of the same problems he’d experienced in Portland concerning the ""criminalization of the homeless"" are happening in Eugene.

""It's a very important thing for me to do right now,"" he said. ""There's a need for someone in this race to make the arguments I'm making.""

Like some of the other candidates in the race, Patterson said he approaches the job as mayor more from the standpoint of someone who can move community conversations and policy priorities rather than function as a chief executive and decision maker.

""The next mayor of Eugene must make a moral argument,"" Patterson said.,created_utc:1586132027}","{created_utc_str:2020-04-05 20:16:09,created_utc:1586117769}","{created_utc_str:2020-04-06 00:13:47,created_utc:1586132027}","{created_utc_str:2020-04-06 00:13:47,created_utc:1586132027}","{created_utc_str:2020-04-05 20:16:09,score:9,upvote_ratio:0.84,selftext:The Register-Guard: Candidates for Eugene mayor.

Got there at about 3:30. Lined up outside with space between people ([https://www.instagram.com/p/B-iS5\_DjjDm/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-iS5_DjjDm/) ) First thing I noticed was that quite a few people were wearing masks, all kinds of masks and bandanas and rebreathers. Maybe about 20%. Costco employees were being very good about directing traffic and for the most part everyone was being very polite and there were fewer people in the building than I had ever seen. That said, some people really need to work on their situational awareness and make room to let people past them. It was a small number of people but it was annoying. Just about everyone had one package of TP.  On checkout there were MANY people who were buying for several people had had to seperate everything out so they had individual receipts or something. Seem like that would be easier to math out after the fact. Interestingly I didn't have to sign for my credit card. Think about that. I had a mask on and I gave no proof of my identity and walked out with over $1000 worth of product. I have a bad feeling someone is going to take advantage of that soon. 

So on the way home I noticed a few things. All the banks had CRAZY lines (except Key Bank?) and Safeway on Coburg was packed! Also some crazy asshole lady nearly ran me off the road at the merge area on 126 before the bridge. I have it on camera. Everyone else was driving fine but she was obsessively messing with her hair.

I decided to go on a walk up the Butte yesterday. It was very chill and quiet and everyone was doing a great job at keeping the 6ft distance by either stepping off the trail or looking for a way to make the 6ft distance the best they can. 

The one group of people who I noticed that didn't give a F about the 6ft was the people running(literally all of them). They wouldn't stop for nothing, they would run right up behind you without shouting behind or give you time to get 6ft away. I had one runner literally brush my left side as he was running up the trail, when I yelled hey man try to keep 6tf away, he turned and said you should do the same! First off if you're coming up from behind in your stealth shoes not giving a heads up then it is your responsibility to give me some notice. 

Then there was the people I encountered while I was hiking down the trail, every person running would not slow down or move out of the way for nothing, my GF had to jump off the trail while a lady just blasted by us like she owned the trail. I'm not exaggerating when I say all of the runner showed they didn't give a F about you or the health and safety of our community.

The Butte is for everyone and if we don't practice social distance then the city will take it away from us like everything else. Also if you brush by my arm again and basically tell me to F off I'm going to smash your head in next time. And to all the runners LEARN how to share the trail, It wasn't build just for you!

2. There was less traffic but not as much less as I was expecting. You know how like on Memorial Day weekend everyone leaves town and the college kids aren't back yet? It was like that.
3. Soooo many semi trucks on I-5 and they were driving way over the speed limit. More than usual. Passing each other pretty aggressively. I imagine outside of town the car traffic is way less and making them punchy.
4. People were driving very politely. Except one jackass who looked like he was heading to the Chase Apts. We was weaving between traffic in a very ineffective attempt to get ahead of traffic...of which there was not much.
5. Downtown seemed the emptiest
6. The bike trail next to the river was PACKED with walkers, bikers and joggers.
7. Saw some shitheads selling TP and such out of the back of a Uhaul next to GJs.
8. I saw no one with any kind of facemask and only the person taking the money in the booth at the dump had gloves.

Don't flip out on me.

1. I had a facemask and gloves on, I only interacted with 3 people. Only one of the people in the booth seemed to do a double take. Other people at the dump studiously ignored me and kept their distance so win/win. Maybe it was in my head because I was self-conscious though. Hard to tell.
2. There was less traffic but not as much less as I was expecting. You know how like on Memorial Day weekend everyone leaves town and the college kids aren't back yet? It was like that.
3. Soooo many semi trucks on I-5 and they were driving way over the speed limit. More than usual. Passing each other pretty aggressively. I imagine outside of town the car traffic is way less and making them punchy.
4. People were driving very politely. Except one jackass who looked like he was heading to the Chase Apts. We was weaving between traffic in a very ineffective attempt to get ahead of traffic...of which there was not much.
5. Downtown seemed the emptiest
6. The bike trail next to the river was PACKED with walkers, bikers and joggers.
7. Saw some shitheads selling TP and such out of the back of a Uhaul next to GJs.
8. I saw no one with any kind of facemask and only the person taking the money in the booth at the dump had gloves.

Aside from that, everything seemed pretty normal. Like, alarmingly normal.

Don't flip out on me.

1. I had a facemask and gloves on, I only interacted with 3 people. Only one of the people in the booth seemed to do a double take. Other people at the dump studiously ignored me and kept their distance so win/win. Maybe it was in my head because I was self-conscious though. Hard to tell.
2. There was less traffic but not as much less as I was expecting. You know how like on Memorial Day weekend everyone leaves town and the college kids aren't back yet? It was like that.
3. Soooo many semi trucks on I-5 and they were driving way over the speed limit. More than usual. Passing each other pretty aggressively. I imagine outside of town the car traffic is way less and making them punchy.
4. People were driving very politely. Except one jackass who looked like he was heading to the Chase Apts. We was weaving between traffic in a very ineffective attempt to get ahead of traffic...of which there was not much.
5. Downtown seemed the emptiest
6. The bike trail next to the river was PACKED with walkers, bikers and joggers.
7. Saw some shitheads selling TP and such out of the back of a Uhaul next to GJs.
8. I saw no one with any kind of facemask and only the person taking the money in the booth at the dump had gloves.

Aside from that, everything seemed pretty normal. Like, alarmingly normal.

My partner and i are uprooting and moving us and our 6 animals from Eastern Kentucky to Eugene so i can attend UO for grad school.
I've visited once last summer and will be house-hunting in April. I'm not so worried about getting the hang of living there so much as finding a place to live! 
We want to buy and I'd prefer to have a 30m or less commute to school. 
Do you love your neighborhood? Is your shitty neighbor finally moving? Is there anywhere we should avoid if we want our valuables unmolested?
I have a realtor and she's been sending me info, but it's hard to do from so far away.

You clicked this post because you were checking out my profile, or perhaps it was linked somewhere. Either way, I appreciate you are taking the time to read this.
 
You might also be wondering why my profile is completely empty aside from this post, but a quick search on Reddit would make that clear to you.
 
Above all I want to apologize for some of my behavior during my time moderating. While I started out creating the Sars-CoV-2 subreddits with the intention of facilitating reliable and fast information, protecting and growing it changed what I focused on in a matter of weeks.
 
Instead of promoting good posts and contributors, I became more concerned with hunting down a portion of users that were involved on subreddits not created by me. This is inexcusable in a public health crisis, and it rightly lead me to step back.

Acknowledging that I am not the suitable person to support the three main subreddits on this outbreak has allowed me to focus on what matters and leave more equipped people in charge. I hope that my initial efforts to build a good mod team and subs somewhat weighs against the nasty mistakes I made later on.
 
Thank you to everyone who has supported me as well as those who kept me sharp and were not afraid to call me out when it became necessary.

His profile suggests he deals with money so of course his first post on November 7th is in r/wallstreetbets. But after that zero posts and comments for months. Sounds like a typical cover to disguise who he really is. I mean not even one post or comment after that? Come on. 

Then once official news broke of the virus on January 20th he rushed and immediately created multiple communities such as r/China_Flu and r/coronavirus as if he already had this all planned. As people joined and posted he suppressed information heavily as you can tell because all of his comments are telling people why a post is being removed. Pretty much anything showing negative things about China is removed. 

My guess is that he is working for the CCP, probably works for them full time and they had this plan all along. His goal was to come into reddit disguised as a normal user and then to create communities that everyone would join that the CCP could control. He must not have a day job because he moderates 24/7. 

If they control those communities, then they control the information that most of the reddit users talking about the virus have. 

When I posted in r/coronavirus complaining about the heavy censorship on the thread and asking others to join my community the post was removed and I was permanently banned without reason. 

He also immediately rushed and made r/COVID19 today almost instantly once the WHO released the name. China is working hard to control the information and so far because of this well...they’re winning.

UPDATE: This may be worse than I thought. His account was created ONE DAY after [Event 201](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**If the link in UPDATE 2 for the thread is not working please search for r/Wuhan_Flu and join it, then try the link in UPDATE 2 and it should work**

UPDATE 2: After searching r/wuhan_flu for “clo” I came across this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wuhan_Flu/comments/ezfpyj/rchina_flu_mod_movement_information/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) It’s worse than I thought. It may be a group of globalists who decided to play event 201 in real life, the account was created one day after event 201 took place. Could this group be comprised of rich people with an agenda? Could they have leaked the virus from the Wuhan Level 4 bio lab by knowing someone inside who is part of their agenda? This is fucking crazy.

UPDATE 3: One of the mods who is heavy on censorship (likely from China/CCP) is a virologist. Maybe he worked in the Wuhan Level 4 Bio Lab...see [this](https://imgur.com/AZETix0)

UPDATE 4: Another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wuhan_Flu/comments/exb1sc/they_are_trying_to_remove_our_discord/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about CLO_Junkie and his friends trying to nuke a discord putting out negative info on China that they couldn’t control!

UPDATE 5: Today February 12th, CLO_Junkie had an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f2sedc/i_am_clo_junkie_moderator_of_this_and_other/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on his subreddit and everyone was pressuring him with questions that I brought about in my post here. Spread the truth!

Also, r/Wuhan_Flu is a now quarantined subreddit. It was the only popular subreddit about the virus that CLO and his peers could not control. They had that subreddit quarantined because they could not control it.

Feel free to follow me for more updates on this and other uncensored information about the virus [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID__19/)

## **NEW** RULES:

Don’t post:

1. Reposts, anything that’s been posted on this sub already is a repost. If the content is 2 hours old, it’s probably been posted already.

1. Low-effort posts, shit posts, shit memes. 
1. Anything NOT related to HK, doesn’t matter if it reminded you of HK, made you think of HK, you feel it’s relevant to the situation.
1. Anything only remotely related to HK, but doesn’t add to the discussion: a t-shirt you got, a graffiti you saw, a facebook post/ youtube comments you screen capped, a picture you drew, etc.
1. Fake news/ sensationalized/ editorialized headlines. Do not change the headline of an article (except for translations). Fact check before posting.
1. Anything without context or is pure speculative.
1. Frequently asked but easily googleable questions, like how you can help, where to buy t-shirt/bumper sticker, what is the endgame, what companies to boycott, etc. Read the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cxsz4i/megathread_resources_for_antiextradition_protest/), look at more posts, do a search, try googling. 
1. Anything of the other hong_kong sub or the sino sub.
1. Threats, harassment, racist/ sexist speech, slurs of any kind. 
1. Anything that breaks [Reddit site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

1. Report content that violates any of these rules. 
1. If you have questions about moderation, use the message the mods function, do not message the mods directly/ individually. 
1. If your post/comment isn’t showing up, it’s probably because your account is too new.
1. Any form of mod abuse in comments or messages or any other channels will result in permanent ban without warning. 
1. Failure to follow any of the above may result in removal of your post/ comment and/or permanent ban from the sub, without warning, at the full discretion of the mods.

## **NEW** RULES:

Don’t post:

1. Reposts, anything that’s been posted on this sub already is a repost. If the content is 2 hours old, it’s probably been posted already.

1. Low-effort posts, shit posts, shit memes. 
1. Anything NOT related to HK, doesn’t matter if it reminded you of HK, made you think of HK, you feel it’s relevant to the situation.
1. Anything only remotely related to HK, but doesn’t add to the discussion: a t-shirt you got, a graffiti you saw, a facebook post/ youtube comments you screen capped, a picture you drew, etc.
1. Fake news/ sensationalized/ editorialized headlines. Do not change the headline of an article (except for translations). Fact check before posting.
1. Anything without context or is pure speculative.
1. Frequently asked but easily googleable questions, like how you can help, where to buy t-shirt/bumper sticker, what is the endgame, what companies to boycott, etc. Read the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cxsz4i/megathread_resources_for_antiextradition_protest/), look at more posts, do a search, try googling. 
1. Anything of the other hong_kong sub or the sino sub.
1. Threats, harassment, racist/ sexist speech, slurs of any kind. 
1. Anything that breaks [Reddit site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

Also:

1. Flair your posts.
1. Report content that violates any of these rules. 
1. If you have questions about moderation, use the message the mods function, do not message the mods directly/ individually. 
1. If your post/comment isn’t showing up, it’s probably because your account is too new.
1. Any form of mod abuse in comments or messages or any other channels will result in permanent ban without warning. 
1. Failure to follow any of the above may result in removal of your post/ comment and/or permanent ban from the sub, without warning, at the full discretion of the mods.

Discussion regarding the potential collapse of global civilization, defined as a significant decrease in human population and/or political/economic/social complexity over a considerable area, for an extended time. We seek to deepen our understanding of collapse while providing mutual support, not to document every detail of our demise.


* * *

Overindulging in this sub may be detrimental to your mental health. Anxiety and depression are common reactions when studying collapse. Please remain conscious of your mental health and effects this may have on you. If you are considering suicide, please [call a hotline](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines), visit [/r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/), [/r/SWResources](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/), [/r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression), or seek professional help. If you are having difficulty coping and looking for dialogue you may visit [r/CollapseSupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/) or the [Collapse Discord](https://discord.gg/gJ7Akn 8).

* * *

Posts or comments advocating suicide will be removed. If you are seeking help you will be directed to [r/suicidewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) and [r/collapsesupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapsesupport). Suggesting others commit suicide will result in an immediate ban.

― William Crawford Gorgas, Sanitation in Panama

Welcome to /r/Epidemic. This subreddit is dedicated to the discussion and following of past or present biological threats to humankind. These can include:

* Current Outbreaks and Pandemics
* Historic Outbreaks and Pandemics
* Biological Warfare or Terrorism

The rules of the subreddit are as followed:

**1. Fear mongering will not be tolerated**

Discussing potential outbreaks are allowed and encouraged, but outright fear mongering will not be permitted and will lead to a ban. Panic can create more damage than actual pandemics.

**2. Spamming is not allowed**

Minor outbreaks occur all over the world all the time. Spamming them will not garner more attention, besides that of the mods. If a larger outbreak or epidemic should garner more attention, we will create a megathread for it.

**3. Be kind**

We are discussing topics that could be potentially sensitive to those around us. If someone is afflicted with a disease or virus, we must acknowledge the situation they are in and be courteous.

**4. No brigading or harassing other locations/subreddits**

**5. Please provide context for discussions**

Finally, a big thanks to /u/EpidemicBilly for granting us control over this subreddit.

The golden rule of submitting drama is: **Don't bore us.**

If a post doesn't fit these rules, if it's entertaining as fuck submit it anyway and we'll look at it to make an exception. If you're not sure, you can always contact us via modmail.


* **Avoid bias and do not submit drama you are directly involved in.** Remain as neutral as possible; biased titles/self posts are grounds for deletion.
* **SRD is not a call-out subreddit.** If your post points out bad behavior more than it does drama, it will be removed. 
* **Do not make us hunt for the drama.** When submitting drama do not link to the full comments, to images, or otherwise to outside of a comment thread. Links to full threads are allowed where the drama is obvious, but use common sense and direct links when applicable. Use ?context when appropriate. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules#wiki_submitting_self_posts_and_write-ups) for more information.

for the nuances of these rules, please read the [expanded ruleset](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules)

###Remember - all judgment is left at moderator discretion.

* Do not post, link to, or ask for personal information
* No trolling, hate speech, or using slurs
* Do not insult other users, flamewar, or flame bait
* Do not /u/ summon users from linked threads
* Do not vote or comment in linked threads 
* Novelty accounts are not welcome in /r/SubredditDrama
* Off-topic grandstanding will be removed
* No post history stalking
* We enforce the spirit of the rules, not the letter
* New accounts get no leeway and will be banned without warning for violating any of our rules

###When in doubt about a rule, please read the rules wiki, or message us for clarification.

Users who break rules may receive a warning via PM or a distinguished comment. You may be warned for rule offenses instead of banned, but certain offenses are ban-on-sight, and **all bans are up to the mod's discretion.**

#Linking

The golden rule of submitting drama is: **Don't bore us.**

If a post doesn't fit these rules, if it's entertaining as fuck submit it anyway and we'll look at it to make an exception. If you're not sure, you can always contact us via modmail.


* **Avoid bias and do not submit drama you are directly involved in.** Remain as neutral as possible; biased titles/self posts are grounds for deletion.
* **SRD is not a call-out subreddit.** If your post points out bad behavior more than it does drama, it will be removed. 
* **Do not make us hunt for the drama.** When submitting drama do not link to the full comments, to images, or otherwise to outside of a comment thread. Links to full threads are allowed where the drama is obvious, but use common sense and direct links when applicable. Use ?context when appropriate. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules#wiki_submitting_self_posts_and_write-ups) for more information.

#Surplus Popcorn

This is the current list of drama that has a higher bar for submission.

* Partisan pissmatch
* Gun drama
* Gender wars
* Racism drama
* Social Justice drama

If you're going to submit drama for these topics, make sure it's quality! See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules#wiki_surplus_popcorn) for more information.

The case for 10k infections:

1. Doctor  talks about outbreak being ""Resident Evil Level"" and more than 10k  infections in a Medical School Alumni WeChat Group (I won't tell you the  specific medical school. But it is in Shanghai, class of 2014. I vetted  the name of the ""whistleblower"". Blocked his name too because this is a  picture sent to me by a friend - who got it from a friend, etc)

[https://imgur.com/gallery/Pp1cCeg](https://imgur.com/gallery/Pp1cCeg)

2.  Unconfirmed social media account

3. This distraught family of a Wuhan doctor (no number was given)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAs8-GZfxcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAs8-GZfxcE)

The case for 100k infections:

1. People's  Daily posting a hashtag #HubeiToOpen100kBeds# on Weibo along with an  article (where the vice governor said 100k beds will be in place soon  across Hubei) [https://imgur.com/gallery/dOCwaMl](https://imgur.com/gallery/dOCwaMl)   It soon deleted the hashtag and the article after netizens freak out  and doubt the official number of infections. (I took these screenshots  personally)
2. A distraught doctor telling her family that 100k infections are estimated.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFcKbEWu3o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFcKbEWu3o)
3. This guy saying his sister, a doctor, told him that 100k people were estimated to be infected [https://imgur.com/a/zzq7ngw](https://imgur.com/a/zzq7ngw)
4. My friend's conversation with her friend [https://imgur.com/a/raBHZKm](https://imgur.com/a/raBHZKm)

Why I am collecting these social media archives:

I  was born and raised in Wuhan. I have been collecting, translating, and posting social media screenshots from friends, family, and the Chinese internet about the situation of the outbreak and what Wuhan citizens and medical workers are going through. I'm doing so because I feel like  none of the news outlet, Chinese or Western, are reporting the true  severity of the situation or the emotional aspect of the outbreak.

Please take all of these with a grain of salt and come to your own conclusions.,over_18:false,id:euzo5e,created_utc:1580181395,title:My social media archive about ""10k"" or ""100k"" infections deleted by r/Coronavirus,is_self:true,url:https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu_Uncensored/comments/euzo5e/my_social_media_archive_about_10k_or_100k/}","{created_utc_str:2020-01-26 00:13:51,over_18:false,subscribers:3229,name:t5_2dsy38,description:,id:2dsy38,created_utc:1579997631,display_name:china_flu_uncensored}","{created_utc_str:2019-10-19 11:10:38,is_employee:false,is_mod:true,is_gold:true,has_verified_email:true,comment_karma:4153,is_suspended:false,id:46kxb4d4,created_utc:1571483438,link_karma:20569,username:CLO_Junkie}"

"" Dont be a jerk "" lol I think it explains itself. This sub was created out of frustration over not being able to share unverified information along with official information. 

This sub is not intended to fear monger or scare anyone
 We do not want to push any agenda or sway anyone's mind. It is simply intended to allow any info to be shared the moment its found. Do not take unverified media as truth 100%. It won't be. However since this started it has proven to be a reliable way to get information out that otherwise isnt being reported. 

If something is proven to be false or a hoax let a mod know and it will be flaired as such. It will be left up with the flair so that others can see it and associate it with ""hoax"". 

If something is already verified it can be flaired that way however nothing is required to be verified.

This premise may not make sense to some and that's ok. Use your own judgement and critical thinking skills and judge the authenticity of what is shared here from other social platforms. Again this is not meant to push an agenda or be a competition against other subs to see who is right/better/etc.

In the end we all want the same thing and that is to be able to have the best and most up to date info on this crisis as we get it. 

That's why there is only one rule. You dont have to agree or believe a post but belittling or harassing the OP or others for commenting  will *not* be tolerated.,over_18:false,id:eu043n,created_utc:1580002618,title:UPDATED RULE.,is_self:true,url:https://www.reddit.com/r/cvnews/comments/eu043n/updated_rule/}","{created_utc_str:2020-01-25 04:08:42,over_18:false,subscribers:5161,name:t5_2dqnia,description:This subreddit is devoted to the freeflow of uncensored information relating to the novel coronavirus that has emerged in Wuhan (2019-nCoV / NCVIP).

― William Crawford Gorgas, Sanitation in Panama

Welcome to /r/Epidemic. This subreddit is dedicated to the discussion and following of past or present biological threats to humankind. These can include:

* Current Outbreaks and Pandemics
* Historic Outbreaks and Pandemics
* Biological Warfare or Terrorism

The rules of the subreddit are as followed:

**1. Fear mongering will not be tolerated**

Discussing potential outbreaks are allowed and encouraged, but outright fear mongering will not be permitted and will lead to a ban. Panic can create more damage than actual pandemics.

**2. Spamming is not allowed**

Minor outbreaks occur all over the world all the time. Spamming them will not garner more attention, besides that of the mods. If a larger outbreak or epidemic should garner more attention, we will create a megathread for it.

**3. Be kind**

We are discussing topics that could be potentially sensitive to those around us. If someone is afflicted with a disease or virus, we must acknowledge the situation they are in and be courteous.

**4. No brigading or harassing other locations/subreddits**

**5. Please provide context for discussions**

Finally, a big thanks to /u/EpidemicBilly for granting us control over this subreddit.

Do you mod a subreddit with an inactive top mod? Submit a request on this page by posting a link to the subreddit in question. 
 
If you already moderate a subreddit that has a top moderator who is inactive in that particular subreddit, but are otherwise active on the site, you will need to use the [top mod removal process here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal) Otherwise, if you are not a moderator of the subreddit, you still need [follow the regular r/redditrequest process.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq)


**PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING**

+ The exact criteria used in evaluating requests is left to admin discretion.

+ Community input is helpful, but please respect that redditrequest is **not** a popularity contest and that any input must be strictly on topic.

+ NO DRAMA. Engaging in flaming, accusations, and general drama will result in a ban from [/r/redditrequest](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/). Keep discussion directly relevant to the request at hand.

+ “Abandoned” subreddits are available for r/redditrequest. Subreddits are considered ""abandoned"" in the event that none of its mods have been active anywhere on reddit in the past **60 days.**

+ “Anywhere on reddit” _means anywhere on reddit._ If you are a current mod, and have a top mod who is inactive in your subreddit but active elsewhere [please follow this process](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal).

+ Note that “activity anywhere on reddit” IS NOT limited to publicly visible posts and comments.

+ You are allowed to request only one subreddit for every 15 days. Choose wisely and make sure the subreddit is eligible before making the request. Multiple requests and ineligible requests will be auto removed.

+ Multiple people can request the same subreddit, though requests are reviewed in a chronological order.

+ You **may not** use multiple accounts to request subreddits.

+ You **may not** request subreddits on behalf of other users.

+ Accounts must be at least 90 days old and must have accumulated at least 500 (combined) karma to be granted a subreddit. 

+ In requesting active subreddits that show recent activity, we may require requesters to have 300+ combined karma that is specific to that subreddit.

+ When a subreddit is requested, an automatic message will be sent to the mods of that subreddit directing them to respond to the request. We allow a 3 day grace period for moderators of requested subreddits to receive and respond to this message.

+ The 3 day grace period should not be taken as an indication of the timeframe within which you can expect a response to your request from the admin. 

+ There will be times when the admins have other issues which are a higher priority than the posts in this subreddit. Responding to requests is something that happens in otherwise free time. Please be patient: modmail status inquiries will not receive a response.

+ Please don't ask for an exemption from the rules.

+ This is reddit ""request"". Politeness will be enforced.

― William Crawford Gorgas, Sanitation in Panama

Welcome to /r/Epidemic. This subreddit is dedicated to the discussion and following of past or present biological threats to humankind. These can include:

* Current Outbreaks and Pandemics
* Historic Outbreaks and Pandemics
* Biological Warfare or Terrorism

The rules of the subreddit are as followed:

**1. Fear mongering will not be tolerated**

Discussing potential outbreaks are allowed and encouraged, but outright fear mongering will not be permitted and will lead to a ban. Panic can create more damage than actual pandemics.

**2. Spamming is not allowed**

Minor outbreaks occur all over the world all the time. Spamming them will not garner more attention, besides that of the mods. If a larger outbreak or epidemic should garner more attention, we will create a megathread for it.

**3. Be kind**

We are discussing topics that could be potentially sensitive to those around us. If someone is afflicted with a disease or virus, we must acknowledge the situation they are in and be courteous.

**4. No brigading or harassing other locations/subreddits**

**5. Please provide context for discussions**

Finally, a big thanks to /u/EpidemicBilly for granting us control over this subreddit. Thank you very much!,id:2s14l,created_utc:1281808831,display_name:epidemic}","{created_utc_str:2019-10-19 11:10:38,is_employee:false,is_mod:true,is_gold:true,has_verified_email:true,comment_karma:4153,is_suspended:false,id:46kxb4d4,created_utc:1571483438,link_karma:20569,username:CLO_Junkie}"

**What we will be discussing:**

A place to share information on emergency preparedness as it relates to disasters both natural and man-made.

Would you survive in the event of economic, political and social collapse? What natural disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes or hurricanes are prevalent in your area? What can you do? What should you be doing now? What do you need to know/have? 

This is a community for those who think that it's better to be safe than sorry, and that we need to start preparing *now*.

**What we will be discussing:**

A place to share information on emergency preparedness as it relates to disasters both natural and man-made.

Would you survive in the event of economic, political and social collapse? What natural disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes or hurricanes are prevalent in your area? What can you do? What should you be doing now? What do you need to know/have? 

This is a community for those who think that it's better to be safe than sorry, and that we need to start preparing *now*.

Do you mod a subreddit with an inactive top mod? Submit a request on this page by posting a link to the subreddit in question. 
 
If you already moderate a subreddit that has a top moderator who is inactive in that particular subreddit, but are otherwise active on the site, you will need to use the [top mod removal process here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal) Otherwise, if you are not a moderator of the subreddit, you still need [follow the regular r/redditrequest process.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq)


**PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING**

+ The exact criteria used in evaluating requests is left to admin discretion.

+ Community input is helpful, but please respect that redditrequest is **not** a popularity contest and that any input must be strictly on topic.

+ NO DRAMA. Engaging in flaming, accusations, and general drama will result in a ban from [/r/redditrequest](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/). Keep discussion directly relevant to the request at hand.

+ “Abandoned” subreddits are available for r/redditrequest. Subreddits are considered ""abandoned"" in the event that none of its mods have been active anywhere on reddit in the past **60 days.**

+ “Anywhere on reddit” _means anywhere on reddit._ If you are a current mod, and have a top mod who is inactive in your subreddit but active elsewhere [please follow this process](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal).

+ Note that “activity anywhere on reddit” IS NOT limited to publicly visible posts and comments.

+ You are allowed to request only one subreddit for every 15 days. Choose wisely and make sure the subreddit is eligible before making the request. Multiple requests and ineligible requests will be auto removed.

+ Multiple people can request the same subreddit, though requests are reviewed in a chronological order.

+ You **may not** use multiple accounts to request subreddits.

+ You **may not** request subreddits on behalf of other users.

+ Accounts must be at least 90 days old and must have accumulated at least 500 (combined) karma to be granted a subreddit. 

+ In requesting active subreddits that show recent activity, we may require requesters to have 300+ combined karma that is specific to that subreddit.

+ When a subreddit is requested, an automatic message will be sent to the mods of that subreddit directing them to respond to the request. We allow a 3 day grace period for moderators of requested subreddits to receive and respond to this message.

+ The 3 day grace period should not be taken as an indication of the timeframe within which you can expect a response to your request from the admin. 

+ There will be times when the admins have other issues which are a higher priority than the posts in this subreddit. Responding to requests is something that happens in otherwise free time. Please be patient: modmail status inquiries will not receive a response.

+ Please don't ask for an exemption from the rules.

+ This is reddit ""request"". Politeness will be enforced.

Welcome to /r/Epidemic. This subreddit is dedicated to the discussion and following of past or present biological threats to humankind. These can include:

* Current Outbreaks and Pandemics
* Historic Outbreaks and Pandemics
* Biological Warfare or Terrorism

The rules of the subreddit are as followed:

**1. Fear mongering will not be tolerated**

Discussing potential outbreaks are allowed and encouraged, but outright fear mongering will not be permitted and will lead to a ban. Panic can create more damage than actual pandemics.

**2. Spamming is not allowed**

Minor outbreaks occur all over the world all the time. Spamming them will not garner more attention, besides that of the mods. If a larger outbreak or epidemic should garner more attention, we will create a megathread for it.

**3. Be kind**

We are discussing topics that could be potentially sensitive to those around us. If someone is afflicted with a disease or virus, we must acknowledge the situation they are in and be courteous.

**4. No brigading or harassing other locations/subreddits**

**5. Please provide context for discussions**

## **NEW** RULES:

Don’t post:

1. Reposts, anything that’s been posted on this sub already is a repost. If the content is 2 hours old, it’s probably been posted already.

1. Low-effort posts, shit posts, shit memes. 
1. Anything NOT related to HK, doesn’t matter if it reminded you of HK, made you think of HK, you feel it’s relevant to the situation.
1. Anything only remotely related to HK, but doesn’t add to the discussion: a t-shirt you got, a graffiti you saw, a facebook post/ youtube comments you screen capped, a picture you drew, etc.
1. Fake news/ sensationalized/ editorialized headlines. Do not change the headline of an article (except for translations). Fact check before posting.
1. Anything without context or is pure speculative.
1. Frequently asked but easily googleable questions, like how you can help, where to buy t-shirt/bumper sticker, what is the endgame, what companies to boycott, etc. Read the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cxsz4i/megathread_resources_for_antiextradition_protest/), look at more posts, do a search, try googling. 
1. Anything of the other hong_kong sub or the sino sub.
1. Threats, harassment, racist/ sexist speech, slurs of any kind. 
1. Anything that breaks [Reddit site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

Also:

1. Flair your posts.
1. Report content that violates any of these rules. 
1. If you have questions about moderation, use the message the mods function, do not message the mods directly/ individually. 
1. If your post/comment isn’t showing up, it’s probably because your account is too new.
1. Any form of mod abuse in comments or messages or any other channels will result in permanent ban without warning. 
1. Failure to follow any of the above may result in removal of your post/ comment and/or permanent ban from the sub, without warning, at the full discretion of the mods.

A place to share information on emergency preparedness as it relates to disasters both natural and man-made.

## **NEW** RULES:

Don’t post:

1. Reposts, anything that’s been posted on this sub already is a repost. If the content is 2 hours old, it’s probably been posted already.

1. Low-effort posts, shit posts, shit memes. 
1. Anything NOT related to HK, doesn’t matter if it reminded you of HK, made you think of HK, you feel it’s relevant to the situation.
1. Anything only remotely related to HK, but doesn’t add to the discussion: a t-shirt you got, a graffiti you saw, a facebook post/ youtube comments you screen capped, a picture you drew, etc.
1. Fake news/ sensationalized/ editorialized headlines. Do not change the headline of an article (except for translations). Fact check before posting.
1. Anything without context or is pure speculative.
1. Frequently asked but easily googleable questions, like how you can help, where to buy t-shirt/bumper sticker, what is the endgame, what companies to boycott, etc. Read the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cxsz4i/megathread_resources_for_antiextradition_protest/), look at more posts, do a search, try googling. 
1. Anything of the other hong_kong sub or the sino sub.
1. Threats, harassment, racist/ sexist speech, slurs of any kind. 
1. Anything that breaks [Reddit site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

Also:

1. Flair your posts.
1. Report content that violates any of these rules. 
1. If you have questions about moderation, use the message the mods function, do not message the mods directly/ individually. 
1. If your post/comment isn’t showing up, it’s probably because your account is too new.
1. Any form of mod abuse in comments or messages or any other channels will result in permanent ban without warning. 
1. Failure to follow any of the above may result in removal of your post/ comment and/or permanent ban from the sub, without warning, at the full discretion of the mods.

# Comment and submission rules

1) **Be civil**

Do not be abusive or offensive to any user regardless of differences of opinion. Memes and joke comments are not allowed. 

2) **Maintain scientific integrity**

We do not expect peer review, but we do expect a level of scientific rigour in comments and submissions; pseudoscientific comments or submissions that run counter to accepted scientific consensus are not allowed. Anecdotal comments are allowed so long as they maintain scienfitic integrity. Political posts are allowed so long as they primarily relate to scientific policy.

3) **Up to date content**

Submissions must have been published in the past 6 months. Submissions covering older stories or studies must be less than 6 months old and contain new developments.

No more than 10% of your activity should relate to material that you are affiliated with. Do not post more than 3 submissions per day to allow a diversity of topics.

5) **No reposts**

Submissions must not be reposts of popular submissions.

6) **No misleading, inaccurate or clickbait titles**

Submissions have accurate and clear titles that inform the reader. Minor editing of titles is allowed if it makes the title and findings clearer.

7) **No rehosted content**

Submissions must not rehost copied or stolen content. Link to the original source where possible.

8) **No spam**

This includes, but is not limited to: surveys; questions; downloads e.g. pdfs.

Discussion regarding the potential collapse of global civilization, defined as a significant decrease in human population and/or political/economic/social complexity over a considerable area, for an extended time. We seek to deepen our understanding of collapse while providing mutual support, not to document every detail of our demise.

Discussion regarding the potential collapse of global civilization, defined as a significant decrease in human population and/or political/economic/social complexity over a considerable area, for an extended time. We seek to deepen our understanding of collapse while providing mutual support, not to document every detail of our demise.


* * *

Overindulging in this sub may be detrimental to your mental health. Anxiety and depression are common reactions when studying collapse. Please remain conscious of your mental health and effects this may have on you. If you are considering suicide, please [call a hotline](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines), visit [/r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/), [/r/SWResources](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/), [/r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression), or seek professional help. If you are having difficulty coping and looking for dialogue you may visit [r/CollapseSupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/) or the [Collapse Discord](https://discord.gg/gJ7Akn 8).

* * *

Posts or comments advocating suicide will be removed. If you are seeking help you will be directed to [r/suicidewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) and [r/collapsesupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapsesupport). Suggesting others commit suicide will result in an immediate ban.

## **NEW** RULES:

Don’t post:

1. Reposts, anything that’s been posted on this sub already is a repost. If the content is 2 hours old, it’s probably been posted already.

1. Low-effort posts, shit posts, shit memes. 
1. Anything NOT related to HK, doesn’t matter if it reminded you of HK, made you think of HK, you feel it’s relevant to the situation.
1. Anything only remotely related to HK, but doesn’t add to the discussion: a t-shirt you got, a graffiti you saw, a facebook post/ youtube comments you screen capped, a picture you drew, etc.
1. Fake news/ sensationalized/ editorialized headlines. Do not change the headline of an article (except for translations). Fact check before posting.
1. Anything without context or is pure speculative.
1. Frequently asked but easily googleable questions, like how you can help, where to buy t-shirt/bumper sticker, what is the endgame, what companies to boycott, etc. Read the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cxsz4i/megathread_resources_for_antiextradition_protest/), look at more posts, do a search, try googling. 
1. Anything of the other hong_kong sub or the sino sub.
1. Threats, harassment, racist/ sexist speech, slurs of any kind. 
1. Anything that breaks [Reddit site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

Also:

1. Flair your posts.
1. Report content that violates any of these rules. 
1. If you have questions about moderation, use the message the mods function, do not message the mods directly/ individually. 
1. If your post/comment isn’t showing up, it’s probably because your account is too new.
1. Any form of mod abuse in comments or messages or any other channels will result in permanent ban without warning. 
1. Failure to follow any of the above may result in removal of your post/ comment and/or permanent ban from the sub, without warning, at the full discretion of the mods.

Discussion regarding the potential collapse of global civilization, defined as a significant decrease in human population and/or political/economic/social complexity over a considerable area, for an extended time. We seek to deepen our understanding of collapse while providing mutual support, not to document every detail of our demise.


* * *

Overindulging in this sub may be detrimental to your mental health. Anxiety and depression are common reactions when studying collapse. Please remain conscious of your mental health and effects this may have on you. If you are considering suicide, please [call a hotline](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines), visit [/r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/), [/r/SWResources](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/), [/r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression), or seek professional help. If you are having difficulty coping and looking for dialogue you may visit [r/CollapseSupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/) or the [Collapse Discord](https://discord.gg/gJ7Akn 8).

* * *

Posts or comments advocating suicide will be removed. If you are seeking help you will be directed to [r/suicidewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) and [r/collapsesupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapsesupport). Suggesting others commit suicide will result in an immediate ban.

A place to share information on emergency preparedness as it relates to disasters both natural and man-made.

Would you survive in the event of economic, political and social collapse? What natural disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes or hurricanes are prevalent in your area? What can you do? What should you be doing now? What do you need to know/have? 

This is a community for those who think that it's better to be safe than sorry, and that we need to start preparing *now*.

##Posting Guidelines

- Got a question? Have you googled it and checked our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/China/wiki) yet?

- Got a VPN question? Please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/wiki/index#wiki_vpns), Google and search this subreddit before making your own thread about it.

- VPN-less and in need of an Imgur alternative? Try [Chimgur](http://www.chimgur.com) instead, custom-made for /r/China.

- Be respectful, avoid sexist, racist or offensive language. Homophobic/sexist/bigoted slurs may get you banned without warning. That includes terms like ""sexpat"" and ""Chinaman"", if in doubt please err on the side of caution.

- Post Chinese translation requests to /r/translator    
  
- The best place for travel advice is still /r/travel or /r/travelchina but if you must post here, be clear and specific as we are not itinerary planners.

- [VISA FAQ HERE](http://lawandborder.com/faq-new-china-visa-law/). Please submit visa questions to /r/ChinaVisa. 

- No advertising or blog spam.

- No meta-drama or subreddit drama. 

- Memes are allowed, but no low-effort circlejerk. Terms such as Tim, Rainy, nong, Vivian etc. will be removed without notice, and posters who use them may be banned.

- Do not create alt accounts for the purpose of attacking another user.  
  
- All reddit links must be NP links : [details](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/14xivv/announcement_a_new_rule_to_discourage_invasion)

- Please post in English where possible. Chinese submissions should be accompanied by English translations and submitted with English titles as 99% of reddit users cannot read Chinese.

- Positive karma is required to post or comment on /r/China.

- When linking to news articles, please use the original title. Editorialized, provocative, inaccurate, sensationalist, and/or misleading titles may result in the removal of the post. If you add an opinion byline, please ensure that it is immediately clear which part is opinion.

- Memes, images, videos, gifs, and other types of media are allowed but may be subject to strict moderation. Media regarding real life people/events should provide appropriately sourced background context or risk deletion. On a spectrum from daily life musings to cultural commentary to political soapboxing, moderation of media will tighten. Media closely related to topics that have already been discussed at length (e.g. Tiananmen Square, Winnie the Pooh) will likely be deleted.

- Please do not make more than 5 posts per 24 hour period. Excessive posting may lead to submissions being removed, or other actions at the discretion of the moderators.

- **If your post does not show up, please message the mods.**

##Posting Guidelines

- Got a question? Have you googled it and checked our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/China/wiki) yet?

- Got a VPN question? Please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/wiki/index#wiki_vpns), Google and search this subreddit before making your own thread about it.

- VPN-less and in need of an Imgur alternative? Try [Chimgur](http://www.chimgur.com) instead, custom-made for /r/China.

- Be respectful, avoid sexist, racist or offensive language. Homophobic/sexist/bigoted slurs may get you banned without warning. That includes terms like ""sexpat"" and ""Chinaman"", if in doubt please err on the side of caution.

- Post Chinese translation requests to /r/translator    
  
- The best place for travel advice is still /r/travel or /r/travelchina but if you must post here, be clear and specific as we are not itinerary planners.

- [VISA FAQ HERE](http://lawandborder.com/faq-new-china-visa-law/). Please submit visa questions to /r/ChinaVisa. 

- No advertising or blog spam.

- No meta-drama or subreddit drama. 

- Memes are allowed, but no low-effort circlejerk. Terms such as Tim, Rainy, nong, Vivian etc. will be removed without notice, and posters who use them may be banned.

- Do not create alt accounts for the purpose of attacking another user.  
  
- All reddit links must be NP links : [details](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/14xivv/announcement_a_new_rule_to_discourage_invasion)

- Please post in English where possible. Chinese submissions should be accompanied by English translations and submitted with English titles as 99% of reddit users cannot read Chinese.

- Positive karma is required to post or comment on /r/China.

- When linking to news articles, please use the original title. Editorialized, provocative, inaccurate, sensationalist, and/or misleading titles may result in the removal of the post. If you add an opinion byline, please ensure that it is immediately clear which part is opinion.

- Memes, images, videos, gifs, and other types of media are allowed but may be subject to strict moderation. Media regarding real life people/events should provide appropriately sourced background context or risk deletion. On a spectrum from daily life musings to cultural commentary to political soapboxing, moderation of media will tighten. Media closely related to topics that have already been discussed at length (e.g. Tiananmen Square, Winnie the Pooh) will likely be deleted.

- Please do not make more than 5 posts per 24 hour period. Excessive posting may lead to submissions being removed, or other actions at the discretion of the moderators.

- **If your post does not show up, please message the mods.**

Discussion regarding the potential collapse of global civilization, defined as a significant decrease in human population and/or political/economic/social complexity over a considerable area, for an extended time. We seek to deepen our understanding of collapse while providing mutual support, not to document every detail of our demise.


* * *

Overindulging in this sub may be detrimental to your mental health. Anxiety and depression are common reactions when studying collapse. Please remain conscious of your mental health and effects this may have on you. If you are considering suicide, please [call a hotline](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines), visit [/r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/), [/r/SWResources](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/), [/r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression), or seek professional help. If you are having difficulty coping and looking for dialogue you may visit [r/CollapseSupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/) or the [Collapse Discord](https://discord.gg/gJ7Akn 8).

* * *

Posts or comments advocating suicide will be removed. If you are seeking help you will be directed to [r/suicidewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) and [r/collapsesupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapsesupport). Suggesting others commit suicide will result in an immediate ban.

A place to share information on emergency preparedness as it relates to disasters both natural and man-made.

Would you survive in the event of economic, political and social collapse? What natural disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes or hurricanes are prevalent in your area? What can you do? What should you be doing now? What do you need to know/have? 

This is a community for those who think that it's better to be safe than sorry, and that we need to start preparing *now*.

Discussion regarding the potential collapse of global civilization, defined as a significant decrease in human population and/or political/economic/social complexity over a considerable area, for an extended time. We seek to deepen our understanding of collapse while providing mutual support, not to document every detail of our demise.


* * *

Overindulging in this sub may be detrimental to your mental health. Anxiety and depression are common reactions when studying collapse. Please remain conscious of your mental health and effects this may have on you. If you are considering suicide, please [call a hotline](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines), visit [/r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/), [/r/SWResources](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/), [/r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression), or seek professional help. If you are having difficulty coping and looking for dialogue you may visit [r/CollapseSupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/) or the [Collapse Discord](https://discord.gg/gJ7Akn 8).

* * *

Posts or comments advocating suicide will be removed. If you are seeking help you will be directed to [r/suicidewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) and [r/collapsesupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapsesupport). Suggesting others commit suicide will result in an immediate ban.

Transmission to healthcare workers is a red flag. Multiple media sources are reporting 15 health care workers infected in Wuhan.   


The next few weeks will be really telling. They could get it under control like they did with SARS, or it could be a real problem.  


Some questions that remain to be answered:

&#x200B;

RO? (Rate of transmission -- how many people does each patient infect.)

Incubation period?

Are people infectious before/after they show symptoms?

Are there asymptomatic carriers?

Method of transmission? (Aerosol, probably; if it's truly airborne like smallpox or measles, that's an oh-crap moment)  

  

I am paying attention to this one.

The World Health Organization has also scheduled  a meeting Wednesday to determine whether this outbreak should be designated a ""public health emergency of international concern"" (PHEIC). More details at the link.

The spread to health workers is potentially very concerning. Health workers typically use PPE when dealing with patients in any circumstance, and the fact that they still caught this means it's likely more infectious than previously thought. Details aren't provided, though, so these may not have been aware and were only wearing gloves, which wouldn't do much.

A quote I found in another article is probably important context for the 3 deaths reported: ""Of the 198 cases detected in Wuhan, 170 are still in hospital. Of those, 35 cases are considered severe and nine are in critical condition."" The % of the total in the hospital is high, but that's probably (hopefully) just reporting bias, but it does seem to be more severe than the 3 deaths might suggest.,over_18:false,id:erig8c,created_utc:1579549556,title:Human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus confirmed, WHO meeting to determine international emergency declaration,is_self:true,url:https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/erig8c/humantohuman_transmission_of_novel_coronavirus/}","{created_utc_str:2010-02-17 22:00:23,over_18:false,subscribers:166280,name:t5_2riow,description:**Reddit Regional Prepping Network**

**What we will be discussing:**

A place to share information on emergency preparedness as it relates to disasters both natural and man-made.

Would you survive in the event of economic, political and social collapse? What natural disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes or hurricanes are prevalent in your area? What can you do? What should you be doing now? What do you need to know/have? 

This is a community for those who think that it's better to be safe than sorry, and that we need to start preparing *now*.

It has also spread across the United States with cases so far in 17 states and 14 deaths, all but one in Washington state.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended here alternatives to face-to-face doctor or clinic visits to help limit exposure to the virus in the United States and free up resources for those who may really need it. Remote diagnoses through telehealth services could play a critical role, although actual testing for the new virus would have to be done in person.

A doctor in a Colorado ski town is soothing wealthy clients who want a cure. And one New Yorker called up the hospital with his name on it.

Like everyone across the U.S., the rich are bracing for a deadly coronavirus outbreak. Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot Inc., watched President Donald Trump’s press conference and wondered if the media was overplaying the risk -- but he also made two well-placed phone calls from his winter outpost in North Palm Beach.

One was to a top executive of NYU Langone Health, and the other was to a top scientist there. Both were reassuring.

“What I’ve been told by people who are smarter than me in disease is, ‘As of right now it’s a bad flu,’” said Langone, an 84-year-old who loves capitalism so much that he wrote a book called “I Love Capitalism!” He plans to come back to New York this month for an appointment. If he happens to feel sick, he will go to NYU Langone, and said he’d expect no special treatment.

Some billionaires, bankers and other members of the U.S. elite are calm, others are getting anxious and everyone is washing their hands. But the rich can afford to prepare for a pandemic with perquisites, like private plane rides out of town, calls with world-leading experts and access to luxurious medical care.

“It’s been a full-on war-room situation over here,” said Jordan Shlain, an internist and managing partner of Private Medical, a high-end concierge service. The company is procuring hundreds of full-body coverings for work that includes visits in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and New York. “We have to beg, borrow or steal. Well, not steal -- beg, borrow and pay.”

Just Asking
Tim Kruse, a doctor who makes house calls in Aspen, Colorado, said “the wealthy aren’t going to necessarily have access to things that the common person is not going to have access to.” But that hasn’t stopped them from asking if they can get their hands on a coronavirus vaccine. “The answer is no. They just want to know.”

Confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide have passed 88,000, and more than 2,900 people have died. The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment for the illness to “very high.” Fear over the economic fallout has upended global markets, plunging Treasury yields to all-time lows and giving the S&P 500 index its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.

One co-founder of a major hedge fund, who asked not to be named discussing his plans, said he’d run in the other direction if his peers start fleeing into doomsday bunkers. He might fly to a house he has in Italy, a country that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises Americans to avoid. Widespread panic, he added, would only make plane tickets cheaper.

Charles Stevenson, an investor who was the longtime board president at a Park Avenue co-op that’s home to several billionaires, has been staying in Southampton.

“I don’t feel concerned at the moment -- it’s not near me right now,” Stevenson said. “If people in the village have coronavirus, I’d get out of here.” He’d fly to Idaho and close himself off in a cabin, he said, and his family could join him if they wanted. “That becomes a personal choice of theirs.”

Wealthy couples who aren’t used to actually spending time together are in for trouble, according to Mitchell Moss, who studies urban policy and planning at New York University.

“This is going to destroy the marriages of the rich,” said Moss. “All these husbands and wives who travel will now have to spend time with the person they’re married to.”

Davos Nightmare
Trump has predicted the virus will disappear “like a miracle,” while Democrats outlined demands for funding that include a guarantee of an affordable vaccine. Face masks don’t effectively prevent the public from catching coronavirus, according to U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, though health-care providers are at risk if they can’t get them. “Seriously people,” Adams wrote on Twitter, “STOP BUYING MASKS!”

Jewel Mullen, associate dean for health equity at the University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School, said millions of Americans can’t afford to stock up on supplies, miss work or have a steady doctor to call for advice -- even on a good day.

“Resources like money and transportation and information give people head starts on protective and preventive measures, and can help create more comfortable scenarios for people to cope with disasters,” said Mullen, an internist and epidemiologist who was commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Public Health. “That’s where you really get to see disparate needs.”

JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest bank in the U.S., stopped employees from going on any inessential business trips. It joined a string of other corporate giants in restricting travel, splitting up teams and traders to different locations, or quarantining staff. Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive officer, said not long before the announcement that he had dreamed he and other billionaires contracted the virus during January’s World Economic Forum in Switzerland.

“I had this nightmare that somehow in Davos, all of us who went there got it, and then we all left and spread it,” Dimon said during the bank’s annual investor day. “The only good news from that is that it might have just killed the elite.” His audience chuckled.
